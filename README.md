Takuzu, also known as Binero or Bento, also available for mobile and tablet, is a distant cousin of Sudoku. This logic game challenges you to find the right combination of 0 and 1. There must be as many 0s as 1s in each row and in each column, there must be no more than 2 same numbers side by side. coast, and several complete lines should not be identical.
